# How to find the ''product\_handle'' of a product?

1\. When you import reviews via our CSV file (file to be downloaded directly from the ''import reviews'' menu), you will be asked to enter a ''**product\_handle**''. Follow the steps below to find your **product\_handle**.

2\. In order to find the **product\_handle** of a product, please go to the relevant product page on your website.

3\. The **product\_handle** is visible on your website page URL. (See below)

4\. Paste the **product\_handle** of the product into the **product\_handle** column of the CSV file you want to import. Be careful, if you import reviews of several different products in the same CSV file, each product has its own **product\_handle.**
